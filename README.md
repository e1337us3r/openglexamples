Some projects that I completed in my OpenGL with C simulation class. Used GLUT in all projects. IDE of use is Visual Studio 15.

<h1>The free falling ball simulation project</h1> 
Click anywhere on screen to drop the ball. Ball stops when it hits a line or dot. Press F11 to reset the sim and create new lines.

<h1>Modulus game project(with a twist!)</h1>
You have 60 sec. to answer as many modulus questions as you can. If you answer right you get point equal to number on the balloon, if not the turret in the center will shoot down your balloon. <br>
